## **About me**

My name is Ilya and I am 18 years old. The keen interest in Frontend developing appeared during the first coronavirus lockdown. I had pretty much free time and decided to begin something new. I completed cources dedicated to HTML & CSS & JavaScript and found my first freelance work. I was making sites with JavaScript elements for a while. I have already got 40+ done projects. Two customers provided me remote partnership. 

* I was developing projects for such companies as L'Oréal (LA POCHE POSAY, SkinCeuticals) and CERAVE working in [LightsOn](https://lights-on.pro/) as remote web developer. 

* Also I was making little projects (mostly calculators - [example](https://ilya703.github.io/Calculator-Dollar/)) for [Siberia Tech](https://siberia-tech.ru/). 

I have got two huge team projects:

* Once I participated one huge project for L'Oréal. We were working in team of 10-12 people and making an interactive many-pages site. The work was divided into subtasks and everyone was developing his own part. At the end we merged all parts into final result. It was an excellent experience of working within a team and communication by means of Git/GitHub. [Link on GitHub](https://github.com/vonLiebermann/Tender)

* The second team project was connected with Adapt authoring tools (a special platform allowing to create courses with help of prepared components). LightsOn was making courses for Sber and it required to add more functional into courses. So our task was to create a new component (quiz-game). The team was consisted of 4 members. I was the main developer and others were helping me. The difficulty was in understanding documentary of that platform because it was in English (that was the first experience of reading documentation in English). Also this project was special for involving mostly JavaScript. [Link on GitHub](https://github.com/Ilya703/adapt-game) - [project](https://ilya703.github.io/Game)

After these two projects I realised that I wanted to continue my studying towards JavaScript and begin styding React. 

My study projects using JavaScript: 

* [Food site](https://github.com/Ilya703/Food-site)
* [Movies](https://ilya703.github.io/Education-project-2/)

My study projects using React:

* [Data base](https://ilya703.github.io/Employees-data-base/)
* [Marvel](https://ilya703.github.io/Marvel/)

In the summer of 2022, I completed an internship at Yandex in the [Toloka team](https://toloka.yandex.ru/). I developed a new interface of the main site on the requester's side, participated in the creation of performance metrics for filling out task cards, fixed bugs, updated the cost table on the requester's page (working with requests from the backend), developed a console command to run acceptance tests.

The results of the internship: I really enjoyed working in a large team at Yandex, my colleagues helped me deal with all the issues, I learned a lot of new technologies and gained invaluable experience in developing a real project.
